## *Full Stack Developer Demi Parrilla*

### About this project:
A page to elaborate a little on who I am and display projects I have completed.

### Technologies used:
+ HTML
+ CSS *including*
    + CSS Flexbox
    + CSS Grid
    + Applied Accessibility

### Getting Started:
Page is set up with a navigation bar at the top with links to the About Me section, Contact Information section, and the Projects links to an alternate page set to open in a new tab. As you scroll down, you will see the About Me box next to a Projects box-this Projects box is only a few of my projects but includes a link to the aforementioned Projects page that includes more of my work. My Contact Information is nested in the About Me box so you'll notice a scroll bar within the box; scroll down and you'll find where to contact me by e-mail, address, and phone. Beneath that contact information are additional links to my GitHub portfolio, my Facebook profile, and my LinkedIn account. At the bottom of the page is a short form for easy contact with fields for a first name, last name, and e-mail address (the only *required* field is the e-mail).

### Mobile Responsive
This page was created to be mobile responsive with IPad Pro and Iphone 5. Instead of the about me, projects, and contact information on the main page, though, there is a navigation bar located across the top and you must click the corresponding link to navigate to a separate page for each section.

### Applied Accessibility
This page was created to ensure easy accessibility with a keyboard, and elements such as `nav` for the navigation bar, `header` for the welcome section of the page which says "Developer Demi", and `footer` where the simple contact form is located for easier screen reader navigation. Keyboard accessibility is ensured with `accesskey` and `tabindex` and corresponds as follows:

    + 'a' for the About Me section

    + 'b' for the Biography page
    + 't' for the Tribute page
    + 'z' for the Arizona Tour Site page

    + 'l' for the last name field of form at bottom of page
    + 'm' for the e-mail field of form at bottom of page
    + 'v' for the alternate Projects page

    2. to jump over to the first link (Biography page) in the Projects box
    3. for the second project in the Projects box, Tribute page
