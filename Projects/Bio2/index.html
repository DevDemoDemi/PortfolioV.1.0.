        <h2 id="aboutme">About Me:</h2>
            <p id="parainfo">Born Demi Marie Parrilla on May 9, 1993 in Sierra Vista, Arizona. Growing up I participated in Marching Band playing trumpet and was a member of the Robotics Club at my high school. I graduated Buena High School in 2011 as an Honors Student and a member of Academic Decathlon. Instead of continuing my education upon graduation, I began working two full-time jobs at Sonic Drive-In and Taco Bell; gaining a promotion at Sonic while training for a promotion at Taco Bell. Two years after graduating, I was blessed with a beautiful baby girl named Zoey Elizabeth and have since been working to become the best version of myself so I can be the mother she deserves and she grows up to be happy, healthy, and confident.</p>
